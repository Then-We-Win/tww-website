# TWW Onboarding
Then We Win is an organization that uses data, knowledge, and meaning, to change our world in the most direct, effective, and efficent ways humanly possible.

# Part 1: The Symantec web - The Midi-chlorians of knowledge
> "Data is created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us; it binds the galaxy together" - Obi-Wan Kenobi
We're sure you've heard about this mystical force known as "data". You've probably heard you leave a trail of data wherever you go, that science will soon use data to cure cancer, end poverty, bring about world peace, improve games, teach us how to be better parents, friends, and even how to love.

Mmmkay. How?

Does it seem like an insurmountable task? A fairy tail? Woo woo science? Do you feel a bit like a child wondering how Toy Story was created? It all seems magical... yet there it is... created by normal humans, things exist today that nobody ever thought possible. They were built using data, to gain knowledge faster and find meaning quicker than human beings ever emagined possible.

The super highway to the future is called the Symantec web, and the fuel that powers it is called RDF.

To learn the true power of data is to understand how to work with it, to interact with it, and manipulate it so it does your bidding. You see,
data, on it's own has very little value. It is only when data is harnessed to create knowledge, and when that knowledge is harnessed to
create meaning that something truly powerful emerges; action, and change, and ends to suffering that nobody even imagined *could* end.

By the end of this part we not only think you'll understand a lot more about data, but that your eyes will be opened, and you will begin to see solutions to things you didn't think could be solved.

Data is something that is very common, yet to weild it with expert skill is tantamount to outright wizardry; people refer to data
experts as unicorns, wizards and socerers. One individual skilled in the ways of data can take on ten thousand who are not. A data expert
can somehow be called in to solve the most complex problems with a few expert strokes on a keyboard. They can use their data to force mind tricks on others, or sway people into bending towards their will.

Yes, as you may be detecting, data also has a dark side.

Come with me, my apprentice, let me show you the ways...

## Getting knowledge from data - Resource Description Framework (RDF)

Perhaps you've heard of Amazon's Alexa, Siri, or the Google Assistant? How do they understand your question and bring back an answer?

In an acronym? RDF.

In fact, regardless of the amazing AI or powerful use of data you've recently seen, chances are increasing that this magic was all based around a simple idea called RDF, which is a way to turn data into knowledge, automatically.

### True understanding of RDF

* Watch a cool video about RDF to quickly understand the basics (like this one): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeYfT1cNKQg
* Visit a cool query service and click on some examples (like this one): https://query.wikidata.org/
* Read a cool article about RDF in the real world (like this one): https://www.wired.com/story/inside-the-alexa-friendly-world-of-wikidata/

* Answer these questions
It's OK to research or "Google" an answer - an answer made by someone else is also an answer, just make sure it's a good answer by understanding it, and put it in your own words, or you'll seem stupid on the subject, because you will be :)

1. Whycome Alexa and Google so knowing for your ask?
2. What is a URL?
3. What is an IRI (compared to a URL)?
4. What is a tripple?
5. In computer science, what is ontology?
6. What is a FOAF?
7. Why do you think it's important to be specific about all these shenanigans?
8. What is a human-readable/writable RDF format? (hint: Turtles)
9. What is SPARQL?
10. What is a graph database?
11. What is different between a relational database and a graph database?
12. What are some good open sources of RDF data?
13. In plain English, what are some amazing things you can think of that you could write a single SPARQL query for and get an answer you always wondered?
14. Bonus (not required): What are some questions you could ask a good graph database that might help you track down corruption?
15. You gotta be kidding me bonus (also not required): What would one of those questions look like in some a SPARQL type format?
16. Now you're showing off bonus (also not required): What question, if you could answer accurately, might help a lawmaker write a better law?


# Part 2: User Interfaces
Only two types of users ever use computers: The living, and the dead (computers). If something living talks to them, it uses cognition to do it. Today, we call cognitive interfaces UI (User Interfaces) and UX (User eXperiences). 

Some apps make you feel great and you understand them with no effort at all. These are great cognitive interfaces.

Some apps make you feel annoyed and are confusing, or take a long time to learn. Sometimes you throw your phone in the toilet and try to flush after using these types of apps. These are *not* great cognitive interfaces.

What makes an interface great or not?  In a term? Cognition. The more cognition something takes, the less you like it.

In 19 terms? A YouTube video [(this one)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYs2Mdyasuc). Watch it to understand how to hack the test below. Also, feel free to Google, just make sure you understand what you're pasting; It will make you a great artist.

## Cognition - The churning that leads to the butter of thought
You, as a (hopefully) alive user, use cognition for everything. Cognition is "thinking". But, *how* do you think? Let's go over the current best way we know to think about how we think...

You think in 2 ways: Fast, and slow. Cognitive scientists call this "System 1" (fast), and "System 2" (slow).

Most people feel "they" are System 1: The experiencing, descerning, calculating, thoughtful human being.

Most people feel their "subconscious" is System 2: The super fast, automatic, knee-jerk reacting, gut feeling, reading these words for you, drives your car and lets you walk while you chew bubblegum human being.

## Cognitive drag - When things are harder than they need to be
Generally, anything that does not specifically adhere to the laws of UX, will cause cognitive drag, and users won't like it.  Check out [this website](https://lawsofux.com/) for a great overview into the most common laws of great design.

## How you think
You, or "System 1"...
Fuel and recharging: Large, slow burning fuel tank that recharges while you play, sleep, or do healthy things that otherwise make you feel good.
When things aren't going well: You feel confused, annoyed, impatient, angry.

Your subsonscious, or "System 2"...
Fuel and recharging: Tiny, quickly burning fuel tank that lasts as little as 0.4 seconds. It recharges when it recieves positive feedback, never shuts down as long as you live - even while you sleep, System 2 is thinking - those are dreams. In meditation, the best you can do is direct it's focus to something consistant.
When things aren't going well: You feel annoyed, iritible, disoriented.

Check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBVV8pch1dM) for details on System 1 and 2 and additional insight into how your mind works.

## Ways designs waste your cognition
People can only think of about 5-7 simple concepts at once.  This is the amount of slots "System 2" has for you. If you put any more in your head at once, you will be unable to recall additional items, and drop thoughts on existing items, and otherwise tend to think poorly about a subject, or have to work harder than you otherwise have to.  This is the absolute largest cause of cognitive drag; in fact, nearly all other causes are based on this cause: Making people think of more than 5-7 concepts at once.

Some people do misguided things like [skeuomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeuomorph), which is an attempt to capitalize on things already familiar to people (see "Jakob's Law"), however skeuomorphism in interfaces makes you think of additional, unrelated concepts, so make sure the feelings you're invoking are relevent and worth it (i.e. a video game, not an app).
